This project entitled “Time Series Analysis using Naive Bayes Classification” is developed using tkinter as front end,Python as coding language and csv file as back end.

Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. 

Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. 

While regression analysis is often employed in such a way as to test theories that the current values of one or more independent time series affect the current value of another time series, 

this type of analysis of time series is not called "time series analysis", which focuses on comparing values of a single time series or multiple dependent time series at different points in time.

This system uses Naive Bayes Classification Technique in order to over come the disadvantage of using regression analysis of time series analysis.

Data set used for analyzing time series is “Indian Premier League 2007-2017 obtained from Kaggle.

The outcome of the model is to predict “Venue” and "Winner" of the match held stadium based on the set of attributes were time plays important role in one of the attribute.
